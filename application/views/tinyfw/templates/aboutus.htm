                                    <p>Developed in India during the Mughal era, Aari is an intricate and labor-intensive embroidery technique, in which fabric is stretched taut over an adda or frame. Artisans use av tiny, awl-like hook to pull loops of thread through the fabric’s surface.

                                    <p>To create a jacquard textile, the desired pattern is coded onto a punch card that determines the placement of “warp” threads, strung vertically onto a loom. The loom operator conveys the horizontal “weft” thread through the warp on a “shuttle.” With each subsequent stroke, the delicate jacquard pattern emerges from the loom’s threads. Maiyet collaborates with master weavers in Varanasi who preserve the tradition of the hand-operated Jacquard loom to create finely wrought, original silks.</p>

                                    <p>Dating back over 3000 years, metal casting is a complex art that has played a critical role in the development and advancement of human cultures and civilization. The fundamental process involves pouring liquid metal into a mold and then allowing it to cool and solidify, but the entire technique may incorporate expertise in ceramics, sculpture and the material sciences. To create its line of hand-cast jewelry, Maiyet partners with master craftspeople in India, Kenya, Indonesia, Italy and France who have been plying their art for generations.</p>
